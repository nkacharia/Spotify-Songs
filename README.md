# Spotify-Songs

I've developed a streamlined song browser tailored for Spotify tracks, 
focusing primarily on the user's top recent tracks. The essence of this browser lies
in its simplicity and straightforward user interface. For optimal functionality, 
it first verifies the Spotify user's credentials and then showcases the song details 
in a list format reminiscent of the Spotify app. This includes details such as song title, 
artist, album, and duration. The backend functionality leverages the Spotify API, 
and the song information is rendered seamlessly using a React Native List.
